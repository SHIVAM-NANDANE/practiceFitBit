    <string name="Pullup">A classic pullup involves gripping an overhead bar and using your upper body strength to raise
        your body until your chin is above the bar. \n

        <b>\n To perform the Pullup:</b>\n \n
        1. Position yourself on the pullup bar using an overhand grip that’s slightly wider than your shoulders.\n \n
        2. Make firm grip and pull your body upwards so that your chin is just above the bar. \n \n
        3. Slowly lower your body back down to the starting position.\n \n

        Since pullups are a compound exercise, they use multiple joints and muscles. Pullups use your lats and biceps
        primarily,
        while also recruiting your deltoids, rhomboids, and core. These are the muscles you’ll need to strengthen.\n \n

        <b>\n The benefits of pullups include : great muscle growth and fat loss ,improved grip strength ,enhanced
            fitness ability ,enhanced mental health.
